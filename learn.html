  <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
  JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
  animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a
  few lines of JavaScript code.)
  <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
  HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining
  paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
  <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
  CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background
  colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.

  <h1>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME?</h1>
  Choose the game difficulty and question content before you start. You can select more than one option in the question
  content. So the question could be about three of these. After that click on the play button. There is one correct
  option among four options. Do your best!!
